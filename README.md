miband-watchface-parser
----------

This project aims to help with creating custom watchfaces for Xiaomi Mi Band 4.

## What's done
Currently this project is in very early stage. Currently working things are:
* Watchface parser and writer
* Watchface interface (for easy watchface creation using an API, still WIP)
* Watchface renderer (still WIP, renderer is implemented parallel with an interface)

## To do
* Saving images in palette mode (currently only reading palette images)
* Automatically optimizing watchface size (things like choosing best bitmap type)
* Graphical interface with as much capabilities as possible (this is the projects main goal)

## Contributing
Contributions are very welcome as I'm working on this project, while working 
and maintaining other projects. 


### Notes about project
This project is a bit messy at this point and many things may change, 
can be completely rewritten or even deleted. Don't blame me for this :D
